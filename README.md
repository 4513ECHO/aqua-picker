Built with [Deno](https://deno.land/) and [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/),
powered by [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy).

### Usage

Please install [aqua](https://aquaproj.github.io) before.

Start the project:

```console
$ deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.

Update aqua [typing definition](./types/aqua.d.ts):

```console
$ deno task generate-type
